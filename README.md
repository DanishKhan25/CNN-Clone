## Project Description:

For this project, I undertook the task of creating a clone of the CNN website using only HTML and CSS. The primary objective was to replicate the layout and design of the CNN website, particularly focusing on the image gallery and news sections. Throughout the project, I utilized various HTML elements and CSS properties to achieve the desired outcome.

To begin, I designed the header section of the webpage. This included creating a navigation bar and incorporating the CNN logo or title to resemble the original website's header. I ensured that the navigation menu was functional and responsive, allowing users to easily access different sections of the website.

Moving on to the image gallery, I employed HTML to define a container for displaying images. By utilizing CSS, I implemented different layout techniques to showcase the images. This involved applying CSS flexbox or grid layout to arrange the images in a grid-like pattern, masonry layout, or even a carousel-style display. Through these techniques, I aimed to replicate the varied image arrangements found on the CNN website.

For the news section, I utilized HTML to structure the content into individual articles or news items. Employing CSS, I styled the news section to closely resemble the design of CNN's news articles. I paid attention to font styles, colors, spacing, and overall formatting to ensure a visually appealing presentation.

To enhance user interactivity, I integrated an onClick event handler using CSS and HTML. This allowed for the implementation of a hide and show functionality. Users could click on specific elements, such as buttons or links, to toggle the visibility of certain sections or elements on the webpage. Additionally, I utilized CSS's z-index property to control the stacking order of elements and ensure the desired layering effects.

Moreover, I prioritized responsiveness throughout the project. By utilizing CSS media queries, I made the webpage adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This entailed adjusting the layout, font sizes, and spacing to provide an optimal viewing experience on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices.

To complete the project, I created a footer section containing relevant information, such as copyright notices, contact details, or links to social media profiles, emulating the footer found on the CNN website.

In summary, this project involved creating a CNN clone using HTML and CSS. It encompassed the replication of various layouts for the image gallery and news sections, along with the implementation of hide and show functionality, z-index for layering, and responsiveness to different devices. By emulating CNN's design, this project demonstrates your proficiency in HTML and CSS for web layout and styling.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for structuring the content of web pages.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It was used to style the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.


It's worth noting that this project specifically focused on utilizing HTML and CSS for layout design and responsiveness
